1. stores questions and answers in database
2. randomly presents a questions from the database, waits for an answer, then presents the answer

How it works:
- To add a question/answer pair to the database:

2. Enter your question
3. Enter an answer for the question

- To practice:
1. Enter 'learn'
2. When presented with a question, enter the answer
3. Compare your answer with an answer from the database
4. To stop practice enter 'stop'

- To close the tool enter 'exit'

As simple as that.
